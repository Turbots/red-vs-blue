== Referee REST API

=== Players `/player`

==== Create a Player

To create a new Player, do an `HTTP POST` on the `/player` endpoint:

include::{snippets}/create-player/http-request.adoc[]

The response will include the Player ID:

include::{snippets}/create-player/response-fields.adoc[]

When a player already exists with the same name, you will receive an `HTTP 409 CONFLICT` response:

include::{snippets}/create-player-that-exists-should-fail/http-response.adoc[]

==== Delete a Player

Delete a player by sending an `HTTP DELETE` request on the `/player` endpoint:

include::{snippets}/delete-player/http-request.adoc[]

An `HTTP 200 OK` indicates the player has been successfully deleted:

include::{snippets}/delete-player/http-response.adoc[]

=== Scoring `/score`

==== Fetch the score

To fetch the score, do an `HTTP GET` on the `/score` endpoint:

include::{snippets}/get-score/http-request.adoc[]

The response will show the current score:

include::{snippets}/get-score/http-response.adoc[]

==== Reset the score

To reset all scores to zero, perform an `HTTP POST` on the `/score` endpoint:

include::{snippets}/reset-scores/http-request.adoc[]

If you get back an `HTTP 200 OK` the score has been successfully reset:

include::{snippets}/reset-scores/http-response.adoc[]

==== Ranking

If you want to get the ranking on all players, including their ID, name, team and score, send an `HTTP GET` to `/score/ranking`:

include::{snippets}/get-ranking/http-request.adoc[]

The response should look something like this:

include::{snippets}/get-ranking/http-response.adoc[]
